                        <p>I'm a student from Kuben Vidreg√•ende skole. This is my second year that i'm going to Kuben. Kuben has both vocational subjects and study specialization, I choose vocatinoal subjects because I like computers and Data and want to work in something in those lines. So far I haven't gotten that much experience of work but recently I went two weeks to Tesla. And I learned a buch of stuff some important others not that much. And you can see that in my Projects tab. Some of my hobbies. Video games, watching series, being with friends outside or in a group chat. </p>

            <p class="Lorem">My two weeks on Tesla. I got to do alot of cool things like fix cars, go on test drives and meet a bunch of new people. The first days I didnt get to do that much and had to watch my superior work. But later on I got to do alot more. Like clean the brakes, change the front bumper and switching out the ram of the computer of the car. The best thing to do was to clean the breaks it was fast and didnt require much skill. The worst had to be to switch out the computer it took 10 minutes to switch out and 5 minutes to switch the ram. Then the wait could take up to 1 hour. And in that time there wasn't alot of things I could do other than being on the phone which I tried to be away from. My two weeks at Tesla was good but it wasn't the best. Some of my complaints has to be working in shifts. Having to wake up 5 every day was very exshausting. Other stuff has to be that the chairs wasn't quite good and alot of waiting. Other than that I had a pretty good two weeks and asked if I could go there next year which they happly accepted. </p>
